## 🧠 Typical ML Pipeline Followed

Each project is expected to follow a structured pipeline:

1. Problem Definition & Assumptions  
2. Data Collection & Cleaning  
3. Feature Engineering  
4. Model Selection & Training  
5. Evaluation & Validation  
6. Interpretation & Limitations  
7. (Optional) Deployment Strategy  

This mirrors **production ML workflows** used in industry analytics and ML platforms.
